```

## Application Architecture

### Internationalization Setup

- Uses `next-intl` for i18n support
- Locale detection via middleware
- Translation files in `messages/` directory
- URL structure: `/[locale]/...` (e.g., `/en/`, `/es/`)

### Email Integration

- Resend API for newsletter/mailing list signups
- API endpoint: `/api/send-email`
- Environment variables:
  - `RESEND_API_KEY`
  - `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL`
  - `RESEND_SENDER_NAME`
  - `RESEND_TO_EMAIL`

### Styling

- Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
- Custom configuration in `tailwind.config.js`
- Global styles in `app/globals.css`
- Lenis for smooth scrolling animations

## Environment Configuration

```
RESEND_API_KEY=re_...
RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=no-reply@nomadsoft.us
RESEND_SENDER_NAME=LustlessMailingList
RESEND_TO_EMAIL=lustless-dating@nomadsoft.us
```

## PM2 Deployment

- Process name: `lustless-web`
- Port: 36942
- Uses `npm run start` (builds with Turbopack and starts server)

## Important Development Notes

- **Next.js 15 App Router** - Uses file-based routing in `app/` directory
- **Turbopack** - Fast bundler enabled for both dev and build
- **Locale-first routing** - All pages under `[locale]` dynamic segment
- **Marketing focus** - This is the public-facing promotional site
- **Lightweight** - Minimal dependencies, focused on performance
- **Email captures** - Main CTA is mailing list signup
